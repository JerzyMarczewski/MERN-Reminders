# MERN-Reminders

The Reminders Web Application is a task management system that draws inspiration from Apple's Reminders application, offering users a seamless and responsive experience. The UI was designed in Figma. This application allows users to effortlessly create, edit, and delete tasks and lists. Adding a personalized touch, users can customize list colors and icons to tailor their task management experience. The application boasts a user authentication system, ensuring secure access through a user login and registration process, complete with password hashing for enhanced security. With user data securely stored on the server, the Reminders Web Application employs a RESTful API, facilitating smooth communication and interaction between the client and server.
